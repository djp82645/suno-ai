Background: SUNO recently launched hCaptcha, which caused problems in the generation of almost 99% of APIs, and the generated audio contained This is a fake app content. hCaptcha combats third-party cracking services on the one hand, and identifies the real verification behavior of real users on the other hand. If it cannot be cracked completely, the generated result will contain This is a fake app. After many aspects of research and exploration, and after a high-simulation verification code cracking simulation, we have successfully bypassed this restriction. 99% of the services on the market may not have solved this problem. Welcome everyone to test and use it~
